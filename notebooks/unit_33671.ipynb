    "As you've learnt in the earlier sections, the KiteConnect API is a set of REST-like APIs that gives you programmatic access to your Zerodha trading account. We will use `kiteconnect` Python package which provides an easy to use abstraction over the HTTP APIs. The HTTP calls have been converted to methods and their JSON responses are returned as native Python structures, for example, dicts, lists, bools etc. You can use it to fetch historical data, view your portfolio and funds, and most importantly, place and manage orders in real-time.\n",

    "In this notebook we took you through the login flow, at the end of which, you got an access token. However, the manual login process is cumbersome to do every time you run your script. A common practice is to **store the `access_token`** after the first successful authentication and reuse it for subsequent runs on the same day. So after generating the session, you can save the `access_token` to a local file (e.g., `access_token.txt`). You will learn how to reuse this access token in the upcoming notebook.\n",
